BlackBerry devices only support .bar files, so you will need to convert Android .apk files first using our Mobiles24 BlackBerry 10 APK to BAR Converter.

Step 1:

Install PlayBook App Manager Google Chrome Extension (supports PC & Mac).


Step 2:

Put your BlackBerry 10 Device into Development Mode (Settings > Security and Privacy > Development Mode).
Create a password if prompted (Remember it).
Note down the Development IP Address.


Step 3:

Connect you BlackBerry 10 Device to your computer via USB.
Open Google Chrome and in the URL bar, enter the IP Address you noted from step 2 and click 'save'. (Ignore any SSL certificate errors. Click 'Proceed anyway').
Login with your Development Mode password.


Step 4:

You will now see the App Manager screen, where you can install and remove apps. To install new apps, drag and drop .bar files into the top right hand corner and click 'Install Apps'.


That's it!
